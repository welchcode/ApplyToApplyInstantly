INDEED AUTOFILLER

This project is intended to allow users to automatically apply to 'apply instantly' jobs Indeed houses on its website. 
So far this project features a web scraper, using BeautifulSoup, to find jobs that are classified as 'apply instantly' and that are classified based on user's input parameters.



Known Bugs

So far I have come noticed one feature/bug that needs to be addressed. Users of this program need to be able to specify their city AND state. So far this program only works well with major metropolitan areas.


Planned Features

I plan to implement more user friendly search parameters and allow users to specify how many UNIQUE jobs they would like to find that are also classified as 'Apply instantly'
More to come...
